# Boosting Adversarial Training with Hypersphere Embedding

## Environment settings and libraries we used in our experiments

This project is tested under the following environment settings:
- OS: Ubuntu 16.04.3
- GPU: Geforce 2080 Ti or Tesla P100
- Cuda: 9.0, Cudnn: v7.03
- Python: 3.5.2
- PyTorch: 1.2.0
- Torchvision: 0.4.0

## The guidelines

We provide the training and evaluations codes on CIFAR-10 / CIFAR-10-C in [here](https://github.com/ShawnXYang/Hypersphere-Embedding-Defense/tree/master/CIFAR-10), and those on ImageNet / ImageNet-C in [here](https://github.com/ShawnXYang/Hypersphere-Embedding-Defense/tree/master/ImageNet), respectively. These codes can re-implements the results in our paper.
